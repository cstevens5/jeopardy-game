# jeopardy-game

A simple jeopardy game made using html, css, and javascript

## Overview

This is an implementation of the classic game show jeopardy. In the game show, contestants answer trivia questions and earn points for each question they answer correctly. In the game I made there is only one contestant, but everything else is pretty much the same. There are 5 categories and 3 clues in each category. Right now the clues are hardcoded in as an object in javascript, but this will be revised later. My goal is to use the jeopardy API that contains every question asked on the game show to improve this project in the near future.

## Installation
